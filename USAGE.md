mongosh

use zehratech

db.events.insertMany([
  {
    title: "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence",
    description: "Learn the fundamentals of AI and machine learning",
    date: new Date("2025-11-15"),
    duration: "3 days",
    location: "Online",
    maxParticipants: 50,

    duration: "2 days",
    location: "Online",
    maxParticipants: 40,
    registeredCount: 0,
    status: "upcoming",
    createdAt: new Date()
  }
])
```

### Resetting Admin Password

npm run create-admin admin admin@zehratech.in NewPassword123!

# When prompted "Admin already exists", choose to update password
```

### Backing Up Database

# MongoDB dump
mongodump --uri="your-mongodb-uri" --out=./backup

# Restore
mongorestore --uri="your-mongodb-uri" ./backup
```

### Viewing Uploaded Resumes

Files are stored in `/public/uploads/resumes/`

Format: `resume_[timestamp]_[originalname].ext`

Example: `resume_1699564800000_johndoe_cv.pdf`

### Clearing Old Registrations

```bash
mongosh

use zehratech

# Delete registrations older than 6 months
db.students.deleteMany({
  createdAt: { $lt: new Date(Date.now() - 180 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) }
})
```
